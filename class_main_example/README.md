## Why Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming helps to:
- organize code in a **clean and modular way**
- reuse code easily
- model real-world concepts (objects with properties and behaviors)
- simplify maintenance and extension of large projects

This approach is widely used in scientific software and data analysis.

- **attributes** (data)
- **methods** (functions operating on the data)

## How to run the example

From this folder, run:

```bash
python main.py
