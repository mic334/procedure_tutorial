# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Example – Branch Overview

This branch contains a folder `class_main_example` with a **practical OOP tutorial in Python**.

Inside the folder, you will find:
- a **class definition** in a separate file
- a **main script** that imports and uses the class
- simple examples using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**

The folder follows the philosophy of **modular, clean, and reusable code**:
- logic is encapsulated in classes
- execution is separated in the main script
- easy to extend or adapt for other projects
