### `python_env_example/`
This folder contains a **step-by-step guide** to:
- check if Python is installed
- create and activate a Python virtual environment (`venv`)
- install required packages
- generate a `requirements.txt`

It is meant as a **basic setup tutorial** before running any Python project.

### `class_main_example/`
This folder contains a **practical Object-Oriented Programming example**:
- a Python **class** defined in a separate file
- a **main script** that imports and uses the class
- a local `README.md` explaining how the example works

The example uses common scientific libraries such as **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.

## How to use this repository

1. Start from `python_env_example/` to set up your Python environment
2. Move to `class_main_example/` to run and study the OOP example
3. Read the `README.md` inside each folder for detailed instructions

## Notes

- Each folder is independent
- Examples are intentionally simple and educational
- The structure is suitable for extension to larger projects or HPC workflows
